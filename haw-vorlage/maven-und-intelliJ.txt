- Apache Maven (Maven is a dependency management and automated build tool for Java projects.) check https://books.sonatype.com/mvnex-book/reference/public-book.html for how to use\\
- IntelliJ IDEA oder Eclipse (An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) allows you to work with our API and configure neural networks in a few steps. We strongly recommend using IntelliJ, which communicates with Maven to handle dependencies.)\\

Neural net weights are initialized randomly, which means the model begins learning from a different position in the weight space each time, which may lead it to different local optima. Users seeking reproducible results will need to use the same random weights, which they must initialize before the model is created.
