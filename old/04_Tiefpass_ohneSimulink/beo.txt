mid:  fg 900   fs 1850
high: fg 12000 fs 24050

Beobachtungen:
1) purelin:
	low, 2N: - 1O did not work
			 - 2O - 9O need a few tries
			 - more neurons doesn't seem to help
			 - order of filter does not seem to matter
			 
2) satlins:
	low, 2N: - works on first time
			 - learns fast most of the time
			 - order of filter does not seem to matter
			 
3) tansig:
	low, 2N: - works on first time
	
4) purelin:
	mid, 2N: - 1O, 9O did not work
			 - 2O, 3O, 4O, 8O does not work always
			 
5) satlins:
	mid, 2N: - learns fast
			 - works on first time
			 - 3O, 4O does not always work
			 
6) tansig:
	mid, 2N: -

	
7) purelin:
	high, 2N: - 1O not working
			  - 1O up to 8 neurons don't work
			  - 2O doesn't always works, stops early when it does
			  - 3O does not always work
			  - 4O did not work
			  - 5O,6O sometimes works
			  - 9O did not work
			  
8) satlins:
	high, 2N: - 1O,2O,3O seem to always work
			  - 4O starts, but not always gives good results
			  - 9O starts, but gives no good results
9) tansig:
	high, 2N: - works, does not stop early
			  - 3O not always good results
